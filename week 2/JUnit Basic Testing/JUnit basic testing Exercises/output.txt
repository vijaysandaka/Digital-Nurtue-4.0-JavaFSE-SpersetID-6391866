=== AAA PATTERN & TEST FIXTURES ===

File: src/test/java/com/example/StudentAATest.java
Target Class: Student.java

Test Methods Executed (9 total):
✓ testStudentEnrollment - Basic object state testing
✓ testGradeCalculation - Arithmetic operations and averages
✓ testLetterGradeAssignment - Business logic validation
✓ testStudentWithdrawal - State change testing
✓ testPassingStatus - Conditional logic validation
✓ testCreditCalculation - Derived value calculations
✓ testInvalidAgeException - Exception testing (@Test expected)
✓ testInvalidGradeException - Exception testing (try-catch)
✓ testNoGradesScenario - Edge case with empty data

Execution Time: 0.031 seconds
Result: ALL TESTS PASSED

AAA Pattern Implementation:
- Arrange: Setup test data and initial conditions
- Act: Execute the method being tested
- Assert: Verify results with meaningful messages

Test Fixtures Used:
- @Before setUp(): Initialize test objects before each test
- @After tearDown(): Clean up resources after each test
- Consistent test environment and isolation

Student Class Features Tested:
- Name, age, grades, major, and enrollment management
- Grade validation (0.0-100.0 range)
- Age validation (0-150 range)
- Average grade calculation
- Letter grade assignment (A-F scale)
- Credit calculation (3 credits per grade)
- Passing status determination (>= 60% average)
- Object lifecycle management (enroll/withdraw)
